Setting up AWS Resources:

dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb'): Creates an instance of the DynamoDB resource.
s3 = boto3.client('s3'): Creates an instance of the S3 client.
bucket_name = 'your_s3_bucket_name': Specify the name of your S3 bucket.
table_name = 'books': Specify the name of the DynamoDB table.
Lambda Handler:

lambda_handler(event, context): The entry point of the AWS Lambda function. It receives the event object and context as parameters.
Handling Different Routes:

if http_method == 'GET' and path == '/books': Handles a GET request to retrieve all books from the DynamoDB table.
elif http_method == 'GET' and path.startswith('/book/'): Handles a GET request to retrieve details for a specific book based on its ID.
elif http_method == 'POST' and path == '/books': Handles a POST request to add a new book to the DynamoDB table.
GET /books:

response = table.scan(): Scans the DynamoDB table to retrieve all books.
return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': {'books': books}}: Returns a response with a 200 status code and a body containing the list of books.
GET /book/{id}:

book_id = path.split('/')[-1]: Extracts the book ID from the path.
response = table.get_item(Key={'id': book_id}): Retrieves the book details from DynamoDB based on the book ID.
If the book exists, it returns a response with a 200 status code and the book details.
If the book does not exist, it returns a response with a 404 status code and a message indicating that the book was not found.
POST /books:

body = event['body']: Extracts the request body containing the book details.
id = generate_unique_id(): Generates a unique ID for the new book.
s3.upload_fileobj(image_file, bucket_name, f'images/{id}.jpg'): Uploads the book image to the specified S3 bucket.
table.put_item(Item={...}): Adds the book details, including the generated ID and image URL, to the DynamoDB table.
Returns a response with a 201 status code indicating that the book was added successfully.
Handling Route Not Found:

If the requested route does not match any of the defined routes, it returns a response with a 404 status code and a "Route not found" message.
Overall, the program sets up the necessary AWS resources, defines the Lambda handler function, and handles different routes for retrieving books, retrieving a specific book, and adding a new book.

It's important to note that the generate_unique_id() function is not defined in the provided code. You would need to implement your own logic to generate a unique ID for each book.

To use this program, you would need to deploy it as an AWS Lambda function, configure API Gateway as a trigger for the Lambda function, and set up the necessary permissions for the Lambda function to access DynamoDB and S3
